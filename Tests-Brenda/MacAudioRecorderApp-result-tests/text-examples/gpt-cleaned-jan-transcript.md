"[00:31] Mike: “Abigail, as you know, it’s that time of year when we do performance reviews.”
[00:33] Abigail: “Yes, I know.”
[00:35] Mike: “Well, let me get right to the point: your attendance is, quite frankly, just not acceptable. You’ve been late over a dozen times, you’ve maxed out all your PTO, and your co-workers say you’re often difficult to communicate with.”
[00:51] Abigail: “I’ve had good reason for being out of the office, and I provided HR with a note from my therapist for the days that I was out.”
[00:52] Mike: “That may be, but on my team everyone has to pull their own weight.”

[01:10] Mike: “If I allow you to be late, it’s not fair to the others. Now, as you know, we have performance objectives that we need to meet in the Claim Services department. Everybody has to do their part.”

[01:31] Abigail: “Well, if you just give me a chance and let me work from home, I promise I can do better. I struggle with distractions in the office, but at home I can concentrate, take breaks when I need to, and work when I feel my best.”

[01:53] Mike: “This is a team-based environment, Abigail. If I let you work from home, then I have to let everybody else.”
[02:00] Abigail: “My therapist said I need to reduce my stress level and manage things differently. Nora, my last supervisor, was really good about helping me out—she knew sometimes I had to come in late because of medication side effects.”
[02:14] Mike: “Well, that was Nora. On my team there’s no special treatment; everybody has to meet the same standards. I run a tight ship.”

[02:16] Abigail: “Are you going to fire me?”
[02:18] Mike: “I’m putting you on a Performance Improvement Plan. Here’s a copy of the written warning. I need you to sign and acknowledge what we’ve discussed and that you understand our attendance policies. If you cannot meet these standards, you will be terminated.”

[02:58] Celeste: “Hi—this is Celeste from HR.”
[03:00] Mike: “Hi Celeste. I think I’m going to need your help. I just put one of my employees, Abigail Simpson, on a PIP and she left my office crying without signing it. I hired her about six months ago from Nora Wallace’s team, and it’s just not working out—I think someone passed off their ‘problem child’ to me.”
[03:10] Celeste: “I pulled up Abigail’s history, Mike. She got solid reviews during the five years she worked for Nora.”
[03:17] Mike: “Well, on my team she’s chronically late, she’s used up all her PTO, and when she is here she’s uncommunicative—she’s barely meeting minimum requirements.”
[03:20] Celeste: “Let me talk to Nora and get back to you.”
[03:22] Mike: “Thanks.”

[03:58] Celeste: “Hi Nora, thank you for meeting on such short notice about Abigail.”
[04:05] Nora: “Sure—come on in. Have a seat. We miss her; I haven’t talked to her in a while. Is everything okay?”
[04:15] Celeste: “Not really. She seems to be struggling—lateness and attendance issues.”
[04:18] Celeste: “Did she ever have trouble getting to work on your team?”
[04:20] Nora: “Not once. We set up a telework schedule. She’s a good worker but has health issues that require flexibility. We agreed she’d see her psychotherapist regularly and then work when she felt best, even if that was late at night—her meds can make mornings difficult.”
[04:40] Celeste: “So she’s a person with a disability, and you provided that flexibility as an accommodation?”
[04:42] Nora: “Yes.”
[04:44] Celeste: “Did that cause issues for other team members?”
[04:45] Nora: “No. We have working parents, people in school—lots of reasons folks need flexible arrangements.”
[04:55] Celeste: “Got it.”
[04:56] Celeste: “I just don’t think her new supervisor is as comfortable with flexible work.”
[05:00] Nora: “Thank you, Nora.”
[05:01] Nora: “You’re welcome.”

[05:04] Celeste: “Mike, before Abigail joins, I wanted to review what we discussed.”
[05:06] Mike: “Okay, sure.”
[05:07] Celeste: “Abigail is a person with a disability. I contacted the Job Accommodation Network and they confirmed that her former supervisor’s flexible-work arrangement was a reasonable accommodation.”
[05:22] Celeste: “In her last role that allowed her to manage medical appointments and medication side effects.”
[05:41] Mike: “I didn’t realize she had a disability.”
[05:43] Celeste: “Mental-health disabilities are often stigmatized, making disclosure hard.”
[05:49] Mike: “My cousin is bipolar.”
[05:53] Celeste: “We don’t need her diagnosis. Employee Relations has her documentation, and now we need a solution.”
[05:59] Celeste: “What do I tell the rest of the team if they ask for flexible work?”
[06:02] Mike: “Is there any reason you couldn’t consider other solid performers? I prefer everyone onsite so I can oversee group problem-solving.”
[06:09] Celeste: “We do have retention issues; flexibility can help retain talent.”
[06:15] Mike: “Oh, I see.”

[06:42] Celeste: “Oh—I see Abigail’s here. Abigail, come on in. Please have a seat.”
[06:47] Celeste: “Thank you for coming. Mike asked me to join to talk through the performance concerns from your last meeting.”
[06:52] Celeste: “First, I’m sorry you left feeling so upset.”
[06:55] Celeste: “I understand from Nora that you were a great performer, and I want you to be even more successful here.”
[06:58] Abigail: “Yeah—Nora was great, and she let me work from home when I needed to.”
[07:02] Celeste: “I didn’t realize your request was for a disability accommodation.”
[07:04] Abigail: “I don’t really like bringing that up at work.”
[07:07] Celeste: “Understood. Now that I know, we’ll create a better schedule.”
[07:12] Celeste: “What will you tell teammates if they ask why you get special treatment?”
[07:18] Abigail: “If asked, I’ll say this is a pilot of flexible arrangements. I’m not a fan of remote work, but some need special schedules—so I’m giving it a chance.”
[07:37] Celeste: “Okay.”
[07:38] Abigail: “You’ll see—if you give me the chance to manage my life and work, I promise I won’t let you down.”
[07:48] Mike: “It’s good to see you smile, Abigail. Let’s keep communication open. I can be rough around the edges, but I do care about my people and want you to take care of yourself.”
[08:05] Celeste: “Thanks, Mike. Let’s draft a trial plan—what you’ll need to work from home and how we’ll make it work.”
[08:20] Celeste: “I’ll put something together. Thanks for being flexible. Abigail, Mike and I will reset the PIP for now, reconvene in a month to see how it’s working, and if you need anything, you know where to find me.”
