This is a classic Xcode "duplicate file reference" error! The issue is that `CombinedAudioEngine.swift` (and likely other files) are being compiled **multiple times** because they're referenced in multiple places in your project.

Found the problem! The issue is **duplicate file references** caused by Xcode's "Recovered References" group. Your files are being compiled **twice**:

1. **Once** from their proper location in `MacAudioRecorder/Services/`
2. **Again** from the "Recovered References" group

## **🔍 The Problem:**

Your `project.pbxproj` shows:
```
"Recovered References" group contains:
├── AudioRecorder.swift          ← 🔄 DUPLICATE
├── CombinedAudioEngine.swift    ← 🔄 DUPLICATE (causing your error)
├── MacAudioRecorderApp.swift    ← 🔄 DUPLICATE  
└── ContentView.swift            ← 🔄 DUPLICATE
```

These same files **also exist** in their proper organized folders, so Xcode tries to compile them twice → **build error**.

## **🛠️ QUICK FIX - Method 1 (Xcode GUI)**

1. **Open Xcode**: `open MacAudioRecorder.xcodeproj`

2. **Find "Recovered References" group** in Project Navigator (left panel)

3. **Delete duplicate references**:
   - Right-click on "Recovered References" group
   - Click **"Delete"**
   - Choose **"Remove Reference"** (NOT "Move to Trash")

4. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```
   Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
   Product → Build (⌘B)
   ```

## **🛠️ ALTERNATIVE FIX - Method 2 (Direct Edit)**

If you're comfortable editing project files, I can help you remove the duplicate references directly from the `.pbxproj` file:

## **🎯 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Use Method 1 (Xcode GUI)**

The Xcode GUI method is **safer** and **easier**. Here's exactly what to do:

### **Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Open your project**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/b432li/Downloads/stable-full
   open MacAudioRecorder.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **In Xcode Project Navigator**, look for a group called **"Recovered References"**

3. **Right-click** on "Recovered References" → **Delete** → **"Remove Reference"**

4. **Verify your proper file organization is intact**:
   ```
   ✅ MacAudioRecorder/
   ├── ✅ Services/
   │   ├── ✅ CombinedAudioEngine.swift
   │   ├── ✅ AudioRecorder.swift
   │   └── ✅ [other services...]
   ├── ✅ Views/
   └── ✅ [other folders...]
   ```

5. **Clean build**:
   - `Product` → `Clean Build Folder` (⇧⌘K)
   - `Product` → `Build` (⌘B)

## **✅ Expected Result:**

- ❌ **Before**: Files compiled twice → "Multiple commands produce" error
- ✅ **After**: Files compiled once → successful build

## **🔍 Why This Happened:**

This "Recovered References" issue typically occurs when:
- Files were moved/renamed outside of Xcode
- Project corruption occurred
- Multiple people edited the project
- Git merge conflicts in `.pbxproj`

The **Method 1 fix** should resolve your build error immediately! 🚀
