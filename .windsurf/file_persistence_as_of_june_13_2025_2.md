Great questions! Let me address each one systematically based on my analysis of your project:

## **1. Finding Automatically Saved Files**

**Automatically saved files are located in:**

```bash
# Audio recordings
~/Documents/mic_recording.m4a
~/Documents/system_audio_recording.m4a

# Debug logs
~/Documents/audio_recorder_log.txt

# Whisper model
~/Library/Application Support/WhisperModels/ggml-base.en.bin

# Temporary files (deleted after session)
/var/folders/.../T/system_audio_*_*.m4a
/var/folders/.../T/combined_recording_*.caf
```

**To find them:**
```bash
# Open Finder and press Cmd+Shift+G, then type:
~/Documents

# Or in Terminal:
ls -la ~/Documents/*.m4a
ls -la ~/Documents/audio_recorder_log.txt
ls -la "~/Library/Application Support/WhisperModels/"
```

## **2. Quoted Text & Behavioral Analysis Saving**

The quoted text in my analysis refers to **example quotes from the Multiplier-Diminisher framework**:

```swift:15-25:MacAudioRecorder/LocalLLMService.swift
// Example quotes from the behavioral analysis system:
// M: "Maria, your analytical skills are perfect for leading the AI integration."  
// D: "We can't spare Jake for that project. He's too valuable here."
// M: "Let's hear the risks. Failure here is okay if we learn."
// D: "This is how we'll do it. No deviations are tolerated."
```

**‚ùå NO, behavioral analysis is NOT automatically saved.** It's only:
- Displayed in the UI (`@Published var summary: String`)
- Manually saveable via "Save Summary" button
- Lost when app closes unless manually saved

## **3. Whisper Model File**

**There is NO separate Modelfile for Whisper.** The `Modelfile` you created is only for Ollama:

```bash:1-3:Modelfile
FROM qwen3:4b
PARAMETER num_ctx 8192
```

**Whisper uses:**
- **Binary model file:** `ggml-base.en.bin` (141MB GGUF format)
- **Direct C API:** No configuration files needed
- **Hard-coded settings:** 16kHz, mono, Float32 PCM

## **4. Transcript Auto-Saving**

**‚ùå NO, transcripts are NOT automatically saved.** They only exist:

```swift:7-8:MacAudioRecorder/TranscriptionViewModel.swift
@Published var transcript: String = ""  // In-memory only
// Lost when app closes unless manually saved
```

**Manual saving only:** Via "Save Transcript" button ‚Üí user chooses location

## **5. Analysis Results with Timestamps**

**‚ùå Currently NOT saved with timestamps.** Here's what's missing:

**Current behavior:**
```swift:40-55:MacAudioRecorder/TranscriptionViewModel.swift
func analyze() {
    // ... analysis happens ...
    summary = result  // Overwrites previous analysis
    // NO timestamp, NO persistence
}
```

**What you'd need to add:**
```swift
// Add this to TranscriptionViewModel
@Published var analysisHistory: [AnalysisResult] = []

struct AnalysisResult {
    let timestamp: Date
    let type: AnalysisType
    let content: String
    let originalTranscript: String
}
```

## **6. Retrievable Analysis with M/D/AD Behaviors**

**‚ùå NOT currently implemented.** Here's what would be needed:

**Current limitation:** Analysis results are just plain text strings with no structure.

**What you'd need:**
```swift
struct BehaviorAnalysis {
    let multiplierBehaviors: [Behavior]
    let diminisherBehaviors: [Behavior] 
    let accidentalDiminishers: [Behavior]
}

struct Behavior {
    let type: String  // "Talent Magnet", "Tyrant", etc.
    let quote: String
    let transcriptLocation: String  // Timestamp or segment
    let confidence: Float
}
```

**The LLM responses contain this info** but it's not parsed/structured for retrieval.

## **7. Temporary Audio Files Location & Persistence**

**Temporary files are saved to:**
```swift:282:AudioRecorder.swift
scOutputURL = tempDir.appendingPathComponent("system_audio_\(timestamp)_\(uniqueID).m4a")
// Where tempDir = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
```

**Actual location:** `/var/folders/[random]/T/`

**"Temporary" means:**
- ‚úÖ **Persist during session** - files remain while app is running
- ‚ùå **Deleted by macOS** - automatically cleaned up when:
  - App terminates
  - System reboots
  - macOS runs cleanup (usually within hours/days)
  - Disk space is needed

**They do NOT persist after session ends reliably.**

## **8. Your Questions Are Very Clear!**

You're asking excellent architectural questions about:
- **Data persistence** (what survives app restarts?)
- **Structured analysis** (can I query specific behaviors?)  
- **File management** (where does everything actually go?)
- **Session continuity** (what's lost vs. preserved?)

## **üõ†Ô∏è Summary of Current Limitations:**

| **Feature** | **Current State** | **What's Missing** |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Audio Files** | ‚úÖ Auto-saved to Documents | Nothing |
| **Transcripts** | ‚ùå Memory only | Auto-save, persistence |
| **Analysis Results** | ‚ùå Memory only | Timestamp, structure, persistence |
| **Behavior Extraction** | ‚ùå Plain text only | Parsed M/D/AD behaviors |
| **Session History** | ‚ùå None | Analysis history, searchable database |
| **Temp Files** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-deleted | Optional persistence setting |

Would you like me to show you how to implement any of these missing features?
